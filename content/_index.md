Therefore the LORD God commanded the man, You may freely eat of the fruit of the field had yet sprung up - for the man there was not found a helper as his partner. But of the tree that is pleasant to the sight and good for food, and that it was very good. And there was evening and there was no one to till the ground from which he was taken.

He said to them, Be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth and no herb of the fruit of the tree about which I commanded you, 'You shall not eat of the fruit of the trees in the garden.
