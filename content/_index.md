# About

I am a software engineering student studying at [Liberty University](https://www.liberty.edu). I love to learn new things and teach people about programming.

I use this site to host my portfolio along with [documentation](https://docs.cameron.rs) for some of my projects.

# What I'm up to

Lately, I have been spending a lot of time with **rust** in personal projects and getting more into low level programming.

I am also getting ready for Fall 2023 when I will be the President of the [Competitive Programming Club](https://lucpc.org)

I'm currently looking for **internships**! Feel free to [contact me](mailto:me@cameron.rs).
