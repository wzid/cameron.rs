I'm a software engineering student at Liberty University. I enjoy **low level programming**, **web development**, and **graphic design**.
# What I'm up to

Currently I am working for [IPConfigure](https://ipconfigure.com) as a **software engineering intern** using **Java**!

Lately, I've spent a lot of time with **web development**. I recently re-designed _this_ website to start using **TailwindCSS** and **daisyUI**.

I am getting ready for Fall 2023 when I will start my first year as the **President** of the [Competitive Programming Club](https://lucpc.org).
