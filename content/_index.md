I'm a software engineering student at Liberty University. I enjoy **low level programming**, **web development**, and **graphic design**.
# What I'm up to

Currently, I am serving as **President** of the [Liberty University Competitive Programming Club](https://lucpc.org).

Lately, I've spent a lot of time with **web development**. I recently re-designed _this_ website to start using **TailwindCSS** and **daisyUI**.

I'm also preparing for the annual [ICPC](https://icpc.global/) competition.
